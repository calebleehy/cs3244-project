One day's data may not provide enough context or historical information for the model to learn meaningful patterns in the data. Furthermore, daily data can be noisy and exhibit significant variability, especially for high-frequency data. Using longer time periods can help smooth out some of this noise and capture more stable trends. Time series data often exhibit dependencies and patterns that span longer time periods.  Hence we will be using a sliding time window of 60 days to calculate the moving average, moving standard deviation, moving min and max, moving range and the moving trend."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"9h7-2zzCj1fM"},"source":["This code creates a dataframe (acdf) containing adjusted close price data, where each row represents a date and includes
